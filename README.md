Simple twinBasic "installer"

This is a SUPER simple project to find the newest released twinBasic zip file from it's GitHub Releases page, download it and, if selected, "install it". Which deletes the current folder and extracts the zip recreating the local folder twinBasic resides in. 

It allows for simply opening the zip or open the folder the zip was downloaded to.

You may select to launch twinBASIC after it is 'installed" as well.

If there has been multiple versions released since the last update, each change log is loaded in the listview
