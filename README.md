# GettbZip
Simple twinBasic "installer"

This is a SUPER simple project to find the newest released twinBasic zip file, download it and, if selected, "install it". Which deletes the current folder and extracts the zip recreating the local folder twinBasic resides in. 

It allows for simply opening the zip or "do nothing", which opens the folder the zip was downloaded to.
